Repository for the paper "TriPosNet"
## Abstract
Most object detection research focuses on identifying a large object covering a substantial part of the image, while small object detection is often overlooked. Small objects are difficult to detect since they contain few pixels and cover a small portion of the picture. We propose TriPoslNet, a key-point based object detection framework that employs a novel key-point encoder and attention mechanism to enhance the small object detection performance. The key-point encoder addresses the representational imbalance between small and big objects by effectively encoding object information in a heatmap representation. The attention mechanism enables the detector to adaptively change the receptive field in order to capture and emphasize small object features on low-resolution representation of the extracted features. To further improve the performance, we developed a fusion module to combine predictions from several output levels of the backbone architecture. Using our suggested method, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the UDETRAC and the UAVDT benchmark dataset, which consists primarily of small objects. For further information, visit.
